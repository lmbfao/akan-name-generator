      <p>The Akan people of Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born.</p>
  
    <p>These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.</p>

    <p>Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name.</p>

    <p>Using the below Akan Name Generator, you can get your Akan name using your date of birth in just one click.</p>
