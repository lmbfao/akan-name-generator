# Akan-Name-Generator

## Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a web application that allows users to discover their traditional Akan name based on their gender and date of birth.

**How it works**
The Akan Name Generator assigns names based on the day of the week you were born.

Given the user has entered a valid date (day, month, year) and selected a gender, when the user clicks "Get Akan Name", then the application displays the correct Akan name based on the day of the week.
